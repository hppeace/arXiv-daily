Neuromorphic computing can significantly reduce energy requirements.\nHere, we present a complete pipeline: efficient event-based training of SNNs\nwith synaptic delays on GPUs and deployment on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic\nchip. We evaluate our approach on keyword recognition tasks using the Spiking\nHeidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets, demonstrating that our\nalgorithm can enhance classification accuracy compared to architectures without\ndelays. Our benchmarking indicates almost no accuracy loss between GPU and\nLoihi 2 implementations, while classification on Loihi 2 is up to 18x faster\nand uses 250x less energy than on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano."}
