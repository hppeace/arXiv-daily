However, the inherent non-linearity and temporal dependencies in SNNs introduce persistent challenges, such as temporal covariate shift (TCS) and unstable gradient flow with learnable neuron thresholds. In this paper, we present two key innovations: MP-Init (Membrane Potential Initialization) and TrSG (Threshold-robust Surrogate Gradient). MP-Init addresses TCS by aligning the initial membrane potential with its stationary distribution, while TrSG stabilizes gradient flow with respect to threshold voltage during training. Extensive experiments validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on both static and dynamic image datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/kookhh0827/SNN-MP-Init-TRSG"}
