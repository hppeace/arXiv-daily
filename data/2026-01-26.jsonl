A multi-view ensemble of sagittal, coronal, and axial SNN models provides voxel-wise uncertainty estimation and enhances segmentation robustness. To address the high computational cost in training SNN models for semantic image segmentation, we employ Forward Propagation Through Time (FPTT), which maintains temporal learning efficiency with significantly reduced computational cost. Experiments on the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenges (BraTS 2017 and BraTS 2023) demonstrate competitive accuracy, well-calibrated uncertainty, and an 87% reduction in FLOPs, underscoring the potential of SNNs for reliable, low-power medical IoT and Point-of-Care systems."}
