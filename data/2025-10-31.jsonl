Given a stream of asynchronous and\nspatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that\npreserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as\nvoxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames\nand voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches\ngives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show\nin our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate\nour tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and\nobject detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up\nto 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We\nachieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases\nwith absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for\nobject detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in\nevent-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the\nproperties of event cameras."}
