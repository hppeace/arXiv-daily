However, these cameras tend to perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras, characterized by low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, have considerable potential to mitigate these issues. Compared to frame-based vision, there are far fewer studies on event-based vision. To address this research gap, we introduce an initial pilot dataset tailored for event-based ITS, covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. We establish a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset, achieving excellent performance."}
