We begin tackling the scientifically existential challenge of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection by deploying deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware. Our approach partitions large, pre-trained networks onto SynSense Xylo hardware using maximal splitting, a novel greedy algorithm. We validate this pipeline with on-chip power measurements, achieving instrument-scaled inference at 100mW. While our full-scale SNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among SNN baselines, our experiments reveal a more important insight that a smaller un-partitioned model significantly outperforms larger, split models. This finding highlights that hardware co-design is paramount for optimal performance. Our work thus provides a practical deployment blueprint, a key insight into the challenges of model scaling, and reinforces radio astronomy as a demanding yet ideal domain for advancing applied neuromorphic computing."}
