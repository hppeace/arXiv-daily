This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based\nAsynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled\nby events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce\nreconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that\nregulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving\ncamera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image\ngradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to\nmost existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an\narbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million\nevents/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative\nexperiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction\nbetween FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's\nreconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from\nghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection\nof fiducial markers.
