This paper presents a case study of using ChatGPT for rapid prototyping in ESA's ELOPE (Event-based Lunar OPtical flow Egomotion estimation) competition. The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing. At the same time, we observed limitations: the model often introduced unnecessary structural changes, gets confused by intermediate discussions about alternative ideas, occasionally produced critical errors and forgets important aspects in longer scientific discussions. By analyzing these strengths and shortcomings, we show how conversational AI can both accelerate development and support conceptual insight in scientific research. We argue that structured integration of LLMs into the scientific workflow can enhance rapid prototyping by proposing best practices for AI-assisted scientific work."}
