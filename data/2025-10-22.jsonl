In this study, we\npropose a novel EEG person identification approach using spiking neural\nnetworks (SNNs) with a lightweight spiking transformer for efficiency and\neffectiveness. The proposed SNN model is capable of handling the temporal\ncomplexities inherent in EEG signals. On the EEG-Music Emotion Recognition\nChallenge dataset, the proposed model achieves 100% classification accuracy\nwith less than 10% energy consumption of traditional deep neural networks.
